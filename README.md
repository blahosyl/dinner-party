## Creating the Heroku app

1. Create a list of requirements by going to the terminal and typing `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`. This popuplates your `requirements.txt` file with the list of required files.<br> 
Push your changes to GitHub.

3. Under **Settings > Config Vars** in Heroku, add  a new var  with the key  `PORT` witht the key `PORT` and the value `8000`.
4. Under **Settings > Buildpacks** in Heroku, add Python to Heroku Buildpacks.
5. Under **Settings > Buildpacks** in Heroku, add NodeJS to Heroku Buildpacks.
6. Under **Deploy > Deployment method** in Heroku, select **GitHub** and connect Heroku to your GitHub account.<br>
Type in your repository name, then click **Search**. When your repository appears, click **Connect** next to it.
7. Under **Deploy > Manual deploy** in Heroku, select **Deploy branch** to deploy manually.<br>
Once the process is finished, the following message will appear:<br>
_Your app was successfully deployed_<br>
Click **View** under the message, and a new tab will appear with your deployed app.
